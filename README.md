# cs465-fullstack

Architecture

    Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).

    - Throughout this project, we used a variety of tools at our disposal to create our full stack application. For Express, we were able to render our HTML on the server-side and then send it over to the client. On the other hand, a dynamic approach like angular would update and change the page once saved without the need to reload necessarily. 
    Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
    - I believe scaling and performance are the two main reasons that NoSql mongoDB database was chosen for this particular project. 

Functionality

    How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
    - JSON is a lightweight data interchange format that is language-independent, while JavaScript is a full programming language used to build dynamic web content. JSON ties together frontend and backend development by providing a common format for exchanging data between the two, allowing the frontend to easily send and receive structured data from the backend.
    
    Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.
    - There were multiple times where I refactored code to improve functionality. For instance, when I was going through with trying to fix the add button through angular. A lot of the old code was not longer supported. Thus, I had to change a lot of it to even get it to work.


Testing

    Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
    - Security is one of the main points of focus during any development of software, be it fullstack or otherwise. In this projectm there were various reasons to need testing of endpoints and adding additional layers of security. There will be a various amount of different type of users who try this application, so due to this we must try to add as much variety to the security as we can.
Reflection

    How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?
    - While I already had a small understanding of fullstack development, I believe that this class has pushed me to be even more confident than I was before regarding how different parts of the fullstack process interact with each other.
